```{r read-data}
#First, import data. We start from a tab-separated file so "read_tsv" will do the trick
#Coding with tidyverse is cool because you can forward the output of one step as input
#to the other step through the pipe ("%>%") symbol. Careful about indentation!
#N.B.: this comment is knit-in as part of the code
demo <- read_tsv('example_annotation_table.tsv', col_types = cols(.default = col_double(), read_identifier = col_character(), descriptor = col_character()))
```

```{r filtering-proportion}
demo %>%
  # DB: reshape a table into a tibble according to the columns selected through gather() 
  # DL: gather() is deprecated, and pivot_longer() is the replacement (check https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html)
  # gather(read_identifier, descriptor, alignmentlength, 2:ncol(.)) %>%
  # DB: distinct() sorts rows containing unique read identifiers
  # DL: Well, it sorts no matter if the field contains duplicates or not...
  # distinct (read_identifier) %>%
  # DL: Keep only entries longer than 25
  # DL: The below actually *keeps* rows that are *shorter* than 25; you probably wanted the opposite!
  # filter(alignmentlength < 25) %>%
  filter(alignmentlength >= 25) %>%
  # Split the descriptor into different columns
  separate(descriptor, c("db_ID", "mrg", "features", "secondary_ID", "phenotype", sep = "|")) %>%
  # Drop columns
  select (-features, -secondary_ID, -phenotype) %>%
  # DL: What you want to calculate is not relative *abundance* but each hit's proportion of the hits for its db_ID.
  # It's misleading to call this relative abundance, I think, since no measure of abundance in the community is taken into account.
  # Anyway, here it goes:
  # first step into relative abundance calculation: grouping by the variable of interest
  group_by(db_ID) %>%
  # second step: calculate occurrence through add_tally()
  # pro tip: count() is a short-hand for group_by() + add_tally()
  # add_tally() is short-hand for mutate()
  # add_tally(db_ID, name = "count") %>%
  #third step: create a new column=variable(relab) with mutate() in which
  #you apply the formula
  # mutate(relab = count/sum(count)) %>%
  # DL: I've never used (or seen) the tally() and add_tally() functions so I'm a bit unsure of what you're doing in the above steps.
  # More straightforward way of calculating relative number of hits since each row is an observation:
  # Take 1/number of rows in the group:
  mutate(relab = 1/n()) %>%
  # N.B.: always ungroup() after group_by() to avoid trouble with group information remaining in the table which affects other group
  # operations, sorting etc.! 
  # DL: ungroup() does not get back a .tsv tabel from the tibble.
  ungroup()
```
