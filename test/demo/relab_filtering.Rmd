```

```{r libraries}

```

As you can see, chunks of text outside of code sections are knit-in as comments

```{r read-data}
#First, import data. We start from a tab-separated file so "read_tsv" will do the trick
#Coding with tidyverse is cool because you can forward the output of one step as input
#to the other step through the pipe ("%>%") symbol. Careful about indentation!
#N.B.: this comment is knit-in as part of the code
demo <- read_tsv('example_annotation_table.tsv', col_types = cols(.default = col_double(), read_identifier = col_character(), descriptor = col_character()))
```

```{r filtering-relab}
demo %>%
#reshape a table into a tibble according to the columns selected through gather() 
  gather(read_identifier, descriptor, alignmentlength, 2:ncol(.)) %>%
#sort rows containing unique read identifiers
  distinct (read_identifier) %>%
#filter out values in alignmentlength lesser than 25  
  filter(alignmentlength < 25) %>%
#split the descriptor into different columns
  separate(descriptor,
    c("db_ID", "mrg", "features", "secondary_ID", "phenotype", sep = "|")  %>%
#drop columns
  select (-features, -secondary_ID, -phenotype) %>%
#first step into relative abundance calculation: grouping by the variable of interest
  group_by(db_ID) %>%
#second step: calculate occurrence through add_tally()
# pro tip: count() is a short-hand for group_by() + add_tally()
# add_tally() is short-hand for mutate()
  add_tally(db_ID, name = "count") %>%
#third step: create a new column=variable(relab) with mutate() in which
#you apply the formula
  mutate(relab = count/sum(count)) %>%
#ungroup to get back a .tsv tabel from the tibble
#N.B.: always ungroup() after group_by() !
  ungroup()
```
