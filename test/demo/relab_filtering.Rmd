```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

As you can see, chunks of text outside of code sections are knit-in as comments

```{r read-data}
#First, import data. We start from a tab-separated file so "read_tsv" will do the trick
#Coding with tidyverse is cool because you can forward the output of one step as input
#to the other step through the pipe ("%>%") symbol. Careful about indentation!
#N.B.: this comment is knit-in as part of the code
demo <- read_tsv('example_annotation_table.tsv', col_types = cols(.default = col_double(), read_identifier = col_character(), descriptor = col_character()))
```

```{r filtering-relab}
demo %>%
  # Keep only entries longer than 25
  filter(alignmentlength >= 25) %>%
  # Split the descriptor into different columns
  separate(descriptor, c("db_ID", "mrg", "features", "secondary_ID", "phenotype", sep = "|")) %>%
  # Drop columns
  select (-features, -secondary_ID, -phenotype) %>%
  # What you want to calculate, I think, is not relative *abundance* but each hit's proportion of the hits for its db_ID.
  # It's misleading to call this relative abundance, I think, since no measure of abundance in the community is taken into account.
  # Anyway, here it goes:
  # first step into relative abundance calculation: grouping by the variable of interest
  group_by(db_ID) %>%
  # More straightforward way of calculating relative number of hits since each row is an observation:
  # Take 1/number of rows in the group:
  mutate(relab = 1/n()) %>%
  # N.B.: always ungroup() after group_by() to avoid trouble with group information remaining in the table which affects other group
  # operations, sorting etc.! 
  ungroup()
```
